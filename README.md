# C# Advanced Object-Oriented Programming
This is the repository for the LinkedIn Learning course `C# Advanced Object-Oriented Programming`. The full course is available from [LinkedIn Learning][lil-course-url].

## Instructions
This repository contains two folders for the contents of the course:
- *Finished*: The fully finished versions of the code examples. Intended to be used as a reference and for help with troubleshooting your own code
- *Start*: The starting point for each exercise. This is the code that you will use in the course to build towards the finished examples.

## Branches
The branches are structured to correspond to the videos in the course. The naming convention is `CHAPTER#_MOVIE#`. As an example, the branch named `02_03` corresponds to the second chapter and the third video in that chapter. 
Some branches will have a beginning and an end state. These are marked with the letters `b` for "beginning" and `e` for "end". The `b` branch contains the code as it is at the beginning of the movie. The `e` branch contains the code as it is at the end of the movie. The `main` branch holds the final state of the code when in the course.

When switching from one exercise files branch to the next after making changes to the files, you may get a message like this:

    Please commit your changes or stash them before you switch branches.
